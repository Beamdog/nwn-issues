# Hello and welcome!

This is the Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition _technical bug tracker_. Please read this document carefully before availing yourself of it!

Thank you.

## Before reporting

1. **If you want to reach customer support, follow this link instead:** https://beamdog.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals. This is a technical issue tracker for technical people. We cannot help you with anything except game bugs. If you have issues running the game, issues with your purchase, or other difficulties not related to bugs in the code and data files, please contact customer support at the given link.

2. **DO NOT REQUEST FEATURES HERE.** This is only for bugs in the game. **Feature requests will be closed without comment.**

3. **DO NOT REPORT MOBILE OR CONSOLE BUGS HERE.** This is only for the desktop build of the game. Bugs on other platforms need to be reported through Service Desk, via the link above. **Reports for non-desktop platforms will be closed without comment.**

4. **Check if your issue was already reported.** You can find all reported issues here: https://github.com/Beamdog/nwn-issues/issues

5. **Have you verified with the latest development build?** Please check with the patch notes first, and try your bug on the latest development build.

6. **Are you reporting for a persistent world that is using NWNX?** Please report NWNX-related bugs with them: https://github.com/nwnxee/unified. We will not address NWNXEE bugs.

## Reporting a new issue

1. After you verified all of the above, click the New Issue button.

2. Fill out the template, keeping things concise and to the point.

3. Pick a descriptive title; try to keep it naturally short, omitting superfluous details.

4. If you are unsure or have doubts, do not worry about specifics. We will be happy to help!
