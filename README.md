# Hello and welcome!

This is the Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition _technical bug tracker_. Please read this document carefully before availing yourself of it!

Thank you.

## Before reporting

1. **If you want to reach customer support, follow this link instead:** https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us. This is a technical issue tracker for technical people. We cannot help you with anything except game bugs. If you have issues running the game, issues with your purchase, or other difficulties not related to bugs in the code and data files, please contact customer support at the given link.

2. **DO NOT REQUEST FEATURES HERE.** This is only for bugs in the game. **Feature requests will be closed without comment.**

3. **DO NOT REPORT MOBILE OR CONSOLE BUGS HERE.** This is only for the desktop build of the game. Bugs on other platforms need to be reported through Service Desk, via the link above. **Reports for non-desktop platforms will be closed without comment.**

4. **DO NOT REPORT SCRIPT, CAMPAIGN, OR PREMIUM MODULE BUGS HERE.** We only deal with the engine and engine data files here. **Reports for script or module issues will be closed without comment.**

5. **DO NOT REPORT SECURITY ISSUES HERE.** Exploits should be handled confidentially. Please contact a developer directly if you have become aware of such a thing.

6. **Check if your issue was already reported.** You can find all reported issues here: https://github.com/Beamdog/nwn-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue

7. **Have you verified with the latest development build?** Please check with the patch notes first, and try your bug on the latest development build.

8. **Are you reporting for a persistent world that is using NWNX?** Please report NWNX-related bugs with them: https://github.com/nwnxee/unified. We will not address NWNXEE bugs.

9. **Remove all content overrides and ensure the bug still manifests.** Make sure you do not have content overrides in place. This includes *all* Steam Workshop items and user patch additions such as CPP.

## Reporting a new issue

1. After you verified all of the above, click the New Issue button. **Make sure you are signed in before doing so; GitHub has a bug where it will not offer you the template list if you come through via the Sign In flow.**

2. Select the template that best fits your type of issue.

3. Fill out the template, keeping things concise and to the point. **Do not delete the template text. A handcrafted wall of text imposes extra parsing effort on the developer, and thus will receive lesser treatment.**

4. Pick a descriptive title. Please keep it naturally short and address the core issue in as few and clear words as reasonable.

5. If you are unsure or have doubts, do not worry about specifics. We will be happy to help!

## Q&A

### My issue was closed without comment!

Does your issue have a milestone attatched to it? That means it was/will be fixed in that version. All is well! Your ticket was likely closed by reference from the internal repository, which GitHub does not show publicly. Of course, you are welcome to keep commenting on that ticket!
